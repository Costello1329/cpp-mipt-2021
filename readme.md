## Rules of the game:

### Lessons:
During the semester, the group will have 2 lessons of C++: 1 lecture and 1 seminar. Course roadmap can be found in the folder `roadmap`.

### Homework:
You'll also have 5 homework tasks during the semester. All homeworks cost 60 points. It's absolutely prohibited to write off, each task must be solved individualy! We'll ban every writen off solution. Furthermore, we'll also ban the solution wrom which the other student has written off. If the simuation will happen again – it will cause an instant retake for both sides. You'll also need to stick to codestyle guide: [Google codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Deadlines:
Each deadline will be stated in the correspoding readme.md file of the task.

### Exam:
I will conduct an online examination: you'll have to complete an online test, solve contest and  attend the talk. Exam costs 40 points in total.

### Final mark:
Your final mark can be calculated with this formula: `x >= 30 ? round(x / 10) : retake()` where x is your semester score.

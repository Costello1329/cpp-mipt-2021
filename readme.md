## Rules of the game:

### Lessons:
During the semester, the group will have one lesson of C++. Lessons are conducted in Zoom. Links to lessons are posted in advance in telegram chat. Course roadmap can be found in the folder `roadmap`.

### Restrictions:
It's absolutely prohibited to write off, each task must be solved individualy! We'll ban every writen off solution. Furthermore, we'll also ban the solution wrom which the other student has written off. If the simuation will happen again – it will cause an instant retake for both sides. You'll also have to stick to codestyle guide: [Google codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Exam:
I will conduct two online examinations:
+ In the first semester you'll have to solve examination contest and attend the talk. Contest costs `30` points, and it's limited in time (look above to find the link). Talk costs `10`. During a talk, you'll get one random ticket from the [first semester tickets](https://github.com/Costello1329/cpp-mipt-2021/tree/master/first_semester_tickets) list
+ In the second semester you'll have to only attend the talk. Talk costs `30` points in total. During a talk, you'll get two random tickets from the [second semester tickets](https://github.com/Costello1329/cpp-mipt-2021/tree/master/second_semester_tickets) list and receive one problem to solve (of course, you'll have to code). Each of two tickets can give you up to `10` points as well as a problem.

### Final grade:
You'll have two final grades for each of the semesters. Your final grade for every semester can be calculated with this formula: `semester_score >= 30 ? round(semester_score / 10) : retake()`.

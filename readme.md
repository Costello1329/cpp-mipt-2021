## Rules of the game:

### Lessons:
During the semester, the group will have 2 lessons of C++: 1 lecture and 1 seminar. Course roadmap can be found in the folder `roadmap`.

### Homework:
It's absolutely prohibited to write off, each task must be solved individualy! We'll ban every writen off solution. Furthermore, we'll also ban the solution wrom which the other student has written off. If the simuation will happen again – it will cause an instant retake for both sides. You'll also need to stick to codestyle guide: [Google codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Exam:
I will conduct an online examination: you'll have to solve contest and attend the talk. Exam costs 40 points in total.

### Final grade:
Your final grade can be calculated with this formula: `x >= 30 ? round(x / 10) : retake()` where x is your semester score.

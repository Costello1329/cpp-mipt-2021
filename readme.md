## Rules of the game:

### Lessons:
During the semester, the group will have one lesson of C++. Lessons are conducted in Zoom. Links to lessons are posted in advance in telegram chat. Course roadmap can be found in the folder `roadmap`.

### Restrictions:
It's absolutely prohibited to write off, each task must be solved individualy! We'll ban every writen off solution. Furthermore, we'll also ban the solution wrom which the other student has written off. If the simuation will happen again – it will cause an instant retake for both sides. You'll also have to stick to codestyle guide: [Google codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Exam:
I will conduct two online examinations (one in each of the semesters). 
Each time you'll have to solve examination contest and attend the talk. Contest costs `30` points n the first semester and `10` in the second respectively.
Contest is strictly limited in time (look above to find links and durations). Talk costs `10` in the each of the semesters. During a talk, you'll get one random ticket from the list: [first semester tickets](https://github.com/Costello1329/cpp-mipt-2021/tree/master/tickets#tickets-for-the-first-semester-exam) – in the first semester and [second semester tickets](https://github.com/Costello1329/cpp-mipt-2021/tree/master/tickets#tickets-for-the-second-semester-exam) – in the second one.

### Final grade:
You'll have two final grades for each of the semesters. Your final grade for every semester can be calculated with this formula: `(semester_score >= 30 && exam_talk_score >= 3) ? round(semester_score / 10) : retake()`. The formula implies that you must get at least `30` points for problems and pass talk with `3` points to get a positive final grade.
